## Why Is My Cat’s Ear So Red?

Cats are masters at hiding pain. Look for these subtle (and not-so-subtle) clues:

### Mild symptoms:
- 🚩 Redness or a light “yeasty” smell (like old bread)  
- 🚩 Your cat tilting their head slightly, as if confused  

### Emergency red flags:
- 🚨 Black, crusty discharge (resembles coffee grounds)  
- 🚨 Loss of balance or walking in circles

- Trap bacteria deeper in the ear canal
- Mask symptoms, making diagnosis harder

> **Mites leave gritty debris—don’t try DIY fixes!**
